# street-distortions-detection

## About The Project

The purpose of the repo is to develop a web app for the detection of violations license car plates and street visual distortions. By leveraging advanced computer vision models, the goal is to provide a robust and user-friendly web page that assists in predicting and recognizing illegal activities related to license plates and street visual distortions. 

## Best Results
This repository contains a Python project that uses YOLOv8, Roboflow and OpenCV. Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and image segmentation model developed by Ultralytics. The YOLOv8 model is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks.

With object detection capabilities, the application identifies and categorizes various objects from color images, focusing on five critical use cases:
- Illegal license car plates
- Potholes
- Dangerous wires
- Wall graffiti
- Garbage.
